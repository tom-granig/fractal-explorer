# fractal-explorer
Zoom in and around a fractal right in your browser, with GPU acceleration. The fractal is computed by the GPU in the fragment shader using the WebGL API. You can save locations that you visit to jump to later. Write your own GLSL code in the built-in editor to generate different fractals. The default fractal is the Mandelbrot Set, going to 100 iterations.

Make sure you have a decent GPU on your computer or mobile device if you want a high frame rate.
